Well, though i know most of you would know, this is hatsune miku! (hope it looks like her),
I found myself in a conflict of thoughts while starting with the line art of this one, as to what to make her do!
well, that conflict served the theme of my artwork and i represented it with the broken radish ( or whatever that looks like) in her hands!
The artwork is in the repository!
